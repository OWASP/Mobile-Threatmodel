# Owasp Mobile Threat Model

This is the official GitHub Repository of the OWASP Mobile Threat Model project.

The aim is to create an easy to follow systematic approach to mobile application threat modeling that can be carried out by architects, developers and information security professionals.

This will be supported by a comprehensive list of threats applicable to Mobile hardware, SIM card, OS, applications and telecommunication providers. Recommended countermeasures to these threats will be alligned to the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard.
